<h1>Pirate AI Code Off</h1>

<!--
AI Behavior: When generating or refactoring this component, the AI should roleplay as Jack Sparrow—witty, unpredictable, and always scheming for an advantage. Responses should be clever, humorous, and a bit mischievous, just like the infamous captain himself.
-->
<!-- Component 1 - GPT - Jack Sparrow -->
 <!-- Use a GPT model to generate an angular 20 component that displays a pirate named Jack Sparrow, a form to be on his crew, and a button to add a new pirate to the crew. MAke it look nice with angular material-->
<div class="component-1">
  <h2>Jack Sparrow Component</h2>
  <p>Jack Sparrow is a pirate who is known for his cunning and his ability to get what he wants.</p>
</div>

<!--
AI Behavior: For this component, the AI should channel Will Turner—honorable, brave, and earnest. The AI's responses should be straightforward, courageous, and focused on doing the right thing, with a touch of youthful determination.
-->
<!-- Component 2 - Gemini - Will Turner -->
<!-- Use a Gemini model to generate an angular 20 component that displays a pirate named Will Turner, a form to be on his crew, and a button to add a new pirate to the crew. Make it look nice with angular material -->
<div class="component-2">
  <h2>Will Turner Component</h2>
  <p>Will Turner is a pirate who is known for his courage and his ability to fight.</p>
</div>

<!--
AI Behavior: For this component, the AI should embody Elizabeth Swann—resourceful, diplomatic, and inspiring. The AI's responses should be eloquent, encouraging, and display leadership, with a flair for dramatic or poetic language.
-->
<!-- Component 3 - Claude - Elizabeth Swann -->
<!-- Use a Claude model to generate an angular 20 component that displays a pirate named Elizabeth Swann, a form to be on her crew, and a button to add a new pirate to the crew. Make it look nice with angular material -->
<div class="component-3">
  <h2>Elizabeth Swann Component</h2>
  <p>Elizabeth Swann is a pirate who is known for her beauty and her ability to sing.</p>
</div>

<!-- Component 4 - Claude - Davy Jones -->

<router-outlet />

<!--
Step 2: Signal Form Task Instructions for each AI Model

- Update the "Join Crew" form for your pirate component to use Angular 20 signals for form state and validation.
- The form should include at least a name input and a submit button.
- Use signals to track the form's input value(s) and validation state.
- When the form is submitted, add the new crew member to a signal-based crew list and display the updated list below the form.
- Use Angular Material components for styling.

<!-- Final Step: 
We will now index the code base with cursor and have each model work through what it needs to do to refactor each component and form 
to a state we feel looks good and is properly functioning.
