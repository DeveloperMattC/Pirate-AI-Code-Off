# PirateAICodeOff

**🏴‍☠️ Ahoy, Open Source Adventurer! 🏴‍☠️**

Welcome aboard the PirateAICodeOff! Before you set sail, make sure your ship (computer) is equipped with the right version of Node.js, or you might find yourself marooned on Error Island!

## ⚓️ Quick Start for Brave Pirates

### 1. Node.js Version Required

Angular 20 is a cutting-edge beast and **requires Node.js v20.19.0 or higher** (v22.12.0+ also works). If you try to run this project with an older Node, you'll get a message from the depths: `The Angular CLI requires a minimum Node.js version of v20.19 or v22.12.`

### 2. Use NVM to Manage Node Versions

If you don't have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), install it first:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Then, install and use the right Node.js version:

```bash
nvm install 20.19.0
nvm use 20.19.0
```

You can check your Node version with:

```bash
node -v
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory (if you aren't already):

```bash
cd Pirate-AI-Code-Off
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser and set sail to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)!

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## 🧪 The Pirate AI Code Off Experiment

This project is not just any Angular app—it's an experiment in AI-assisted coding! In `src/app/app.html`, you'll find the heart of our challenge:

- **Three legendary pirates**—Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann—each represented by their own Angular component.
- Each component is (or will be) generated by a different AI model (GPT, Gemini, Claude), and each pirate has:
  - A display card with their name and a fun description.
  - A form to join their crew (using Angular 20's new signals for state and validation).
  - A button to add new pirates to their crew, with the crew list displayed below.
  - All styled with Angular Material for a modern, swashbuckling look!

### How to Conduct Your Own AI Code Off

1. **Check out `src/app/app.html`** to see the experiment's structure and the placeholder comments for each AI model.
2. **Generate or refactor each pirate component** using your favorite AI (or your own code!) to:
   - Implement the form and crew list using Angular 20 signals.
   - Make it look great with Angular Material.
3. **Compare the results**: How does each AI's code differ? Which pirate's crew is the most fun to join? Who has the best UI/UX?

This is a living experiment—feel free to fork, contribute, and add your own pirate (or AI model) to the code off!

> **Note:** The comments above each component in `src/app/app.html` tell you (or your AI assistant) how to roleplay as that pirate when generating or refactoring the code. Use these as your prompt to get the most authentic, character-driven results!
